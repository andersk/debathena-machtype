.TH MACHTYPE 1 "December 17 1994"
.SH NAME
machtype \- Print machine type to standard output
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B machtype
[-c] [-d] [-r] [-M] [-v] [-A] [-L] [-P] [-V] [-N] [-E] [-S] [-k kernel] [-m memory] 
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Machtype
prints the CPU type to standard output.  It prints "vax" when run on a
VAX processor, "rt" when run on an IBM RT/PC workstation, "decmips"
when run on a DECstation 3100 (pmax), and "rsaix" when run on an IBM RS6000. 
.TP
.B -c
Print the specific cpu type, one of VAX780, VAX750, VAX730, VAX8600,
VAX8200, MVAX-II, VAXSTAR, CVAXSTAR, or VAX650 (on a VAX), RTPC-ROMPC,
RTPC-SGP, RTPC-MOD135, IBM-ATR (on an IBM RT/PC), KN01 (on a Decstation
3100), KN02 (DS 5000), KN210 (DS 5400), KN220 (DS5500), KN02ba (DS5000/100),
KN02ca (DS5000/25; "Maxine"), KN??? (unknown decstation) or POWER
(on a IBM RISC/6000).
.TP
.B -d
Print the types of display heads attached to the system, one or more
of QVSS, QDSS, SM, SG, PLX, or VS100 (VAX), apa16, aed, apa8, plx, or mpel
(RT), or PM-MONO or PM-COLOR (pmax), or colorgda, graygda, hiprfmge,
hispd3d, sga (or other displays defined by IBM in the future)
(rsaix).
.TP
.B -r
Print the types of any disk drives attached will be printed, one to a
line, as in "ra0: RD53".
.TP
.B -M
Print the physical memory present (in hex) (in K on the RISC/6000).
.TP
.B -k
Override the default kernel:
.I /vmunix.
This does not have any effect on the RISC/6000, since it is getting the
information from the ODM, not the kernel.
.TP
.B -m
Override the default memory:
.I /dev/kmem
used to look up the specific cpu type, displays, and disk drives.
This does not have any effect on the RISC/6000, since it is getting the
information from the ODM, not kmem.
.TP
.B -v
Verbose output (suitable for humans to read, instead of computers).
.TP
.B -V
(RISC/6000 only) Print out complete hardware configuration as known by the
ODM.
.TP
.B -A
Print out the release that machtype was compiled under.
.TP
.B -P
Print out the version of the Athena system packs attached, from 
.I /srvd/.rvdinfo
.TP
.B -L
Print out the version of Athena installed on the local system from
.I /etc/athena/version.
.TP
.B -N
Print out the name of the base operating system; if used with the "-v" flag,
the version number of the OS will be included as well.  Current values for
the name of the base OS are "BSD", "Ultrix", and "AIX".
.TP
.B -E
Print out the version number of the base operating system.
.TP
.B -S
Print out the "Athena System" name for the current architecture. This
value is normally stored in the environment variable ATHENA_SYS, and
ideally corresponds to the AFS system name for the same machine
assuming the machine were running AFS. This value is used in the Athena
environment as part of a scheme for laying out filesystems containing
binaries for multiple architectures. See \fIlockers\fR(7) for more
information.
.PP
.I Machtype
is useful for conditionalizing shell scripts, .login files, etc. in an
environment that contains filesystems shared across several different
architectures.

.SH BUGS
Disk types can not be read for rd disk drives (i.e. on the VAXstation
2000), or for SCSI drives on the IBM RT/PC.  The disk size on the RISC/6000 is
not always present in the ODM database, although it can be gotten from the
names printed out with the -v flag.
