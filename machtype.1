.TH MACHTYPE 1 "Setpember 6 1989"
.SH NAME
machtype \- Print machine type to standard output
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B machtype
[-c] [-d] [-r] [-M] [-v] [-k kernel] [-m memory]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Machtype
prints the CPU type to standard output.  It prints "vax" when run on a
VAX processor, "rt" when run on an IBM RT/PC workstation, "decmips"
when run on a DECstation 3100 (pmax), and "rios" when run on an IBM RS6000. 
.TP
.B -c
Print the specific cpu type, one of VAX780, VAX750, VAX730, VAX8600,
VAX8200, MVAX-II, VAXSTAR, CVAXSTAR, or VAX650 (on a VAX), RTPC-ROMPC,
RTPC-SGP, RTPC-MOD135, IBM-ATR (on an IBM RT/PC), KN01 (on a pmax), or POWER
(on a rios).
.TP
.B -d
Print the types of display heads attached to the system, one or more
of QVSS, QDSS, SM, SG, PLX, or VS100 (VAX), apa16, aed, apa8, plx, or mpel
(RT), or PM-MONO or PM-COLOR (pmax), or colorgda, graygda, hiprfmge, hispd3d
(rios).
.TP
.B -r
Print the types of any disk drives attached will be printed, one to a
line, as in "ra0: RD53".
.TP
.B -M
Print the physical memory present (in hex) (in K on the rios).
.TP
.B -k
Override the default kernel:
.I /vmunix.
This does not have any effect on the rios, since it is getting the
information from the ODM, not the kernel.
.TP
.B -m
Override the default memory:
.I /dev/kmem
used to look up the specific cpu type, displays, and disk drives.
This does not have any effect on the rios, since it is getting the
information from the ODM, not kmem.
.TP
.B -v
Verbose output (suitable for humans to read, instead of computers).
.PP
.I Machtype
is useful for conditionalizing shell scripts, .login files, etc. in an
environment that contains filesystems shared across several different
architectures.
.PP
.SH EXAMPLE
To set your search path for commands in your .login file to include a
machine-specific directory in your home directory.
.PP
set path=(~/`machtype`Bin $path)
.SH SEE ALSO
csh(1)
.SH BUGS
Disk types can not be read for rd disk drives (i.e. on the VAXstation
2000), or for SCSI drives on the IBM RT/PC.  The disk size on the rios is
not always present in the ODM database, although it can be gotten from the
names printed out with the -v flag.
